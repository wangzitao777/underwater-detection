# Underwater Detection

## Description

This project is designed to provide a YOLOv8 based object dectection method for Forward-Looking Sonar (FLS) images. It aims to integrate YOLOv8 with attention mechanism and make detection more robust with a preprocessing module.

## Features

- A threshold-adaptive judgment criterion is proposed to limit the influences of artifacts. And contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is used to improve the contrast of FLS images and make them easier to interpret. In addition, a wiener filter is applied further to reduce the effects of noise and improve the overall image quality.
- To further suppress irrelevant noise and extract useful features from FLS images, convolutional block attention module (CBAM) is added to the network head while not increasing computational complexity.
- [Include any additional features]
